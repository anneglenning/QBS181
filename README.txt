This document contains a high level overview of the structure of this repository as well as a one-sentence 
description and I/O for each relevant document.

STRUCTURE:

There are three main folders in this document. Data contains all the data files, Dashboard contains all the 
files relating to the creation of the dashboard, and Scripts contain all other scripts for 
replicating this project.


/Data:

The original data files are 2020data.rdata and annual_aqi_by_county_2020.csv. 

2020data.rdata is all sourced and available publicly, coming from a research project.

annual_aqi_by_county_2020.csv is available at the following link: 
https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual

These data files are merged in SAL Project 1.Rmd and saved as final_data.Rdata, which is used for all 
other analysis. The meta data explaining final_data.Rdata is in MetaData.xlsx.


The last data file is map_data.rdata which contains the variable information from final_data merged 
with state geographical boundaries from an API, created in MaricopaCase.Rmd. It is only used again by App.R
to allow the dashboard easy access to the data.


/Scripts

The first script is SAL Project 1.Rmd. This file takes 2020data.rdata and annual_aqi_by_county_2020.csv 
as input, merges and cleans them up, and saves them as final_data.Rdata.

Next is SabinAnalysis.R. This file uses final_data and has no outputs. It analyzes the missing data value 
and finds no issues for later analysis.

Next is Annie_Analysis.Rmd. This loads in final_data and has no output. It analyzes the data based on 
income and performs some correlation analysis and tests.

Next are MaricopaCase.Rmd and custom_boxplot_function.R. custom boxplot is a library used by MaricopaCase.Rmd
and simply implements a function with no file inputs or outputs. MaricopaCase takes final_data as input and 
map_data as output. It analyzes the AQI data for regions of the US at a State and County level.


/Dashboard

Inside of Dashboard is App.R and a folder. The folder is autogenerated by rsconnect and controls the cloud app 
deployment but does not need to be accessed. The App.R contains all functionality for the dashboard. It loads 
in final and map data and outputs a local/cloud hosted dashboard.
